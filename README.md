# 1.ColorChangesOnDistance
Created a shader which calculates distances between gameobjects to the main camera. With different distance values, it applies different colors on objects.

The major investigations in this project:
1. Distances + color : The shader file contains how to calculate distances and render color
2. Simple harmonic motion: Two scripts on generating different heights of "wave" - different vectors on cos()

The purpose of this project is to make the first attempt on creating ocean wave. And users can use the start button to dynamically adding more rows of spheres as shown below:
